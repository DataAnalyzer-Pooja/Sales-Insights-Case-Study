- To attract more customers, organization should adopt the successful sales strategies used by Delhi NCR which has proven to be our most lucrative market. These strategies can be implemented in other markets to increase business.
- To improve profit margins, organization should focus on optimizing the E-commerce business as it contributes significantly in revenue by enhancing the website's user experience, offering personalized product recommendations and leveraging customer reviews and ratings to build trust.

- Sales performance for the FY-2020 is continuously declining. One possible reason for declining sales could be the dynamic retail market affected by COVID-19.
